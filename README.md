Electrical Profiles

The electrical profiles comprise the profiles for household loads, heat pumps, electric vehicles and PV systems. They are provided in the folder 'electrical_profiles' and were separated into seasonal periods. All profiles are compressed into a pickle file. To decompress them, use the script 'decompress_inputfiles.py'.
